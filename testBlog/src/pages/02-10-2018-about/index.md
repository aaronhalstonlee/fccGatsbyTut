so. hello. my name is aaron, as i’m sure you already read. i am an ASE certified master automobile technician. i’ve been working on cars, professionally, for about 6 years. my thumbs hurt. and my hands are always dirty.

i’m also a husband, i have been one for almost 12 years, and i will be one until i die i guess.

and i have a thousand kids. well, 3. but sometimes it feels like more. i can’t imagine what people with more kids feel. well, i kind of have an idea.

enter programming.

one day about a year ago i was trying to do something in a spreadsheet and wanted some sort of function to happen, i don’t really remember what. but i couldn’t figure it out with what limited spreadsheet skills i had. so i googled it. then i stumbled over ‘ruby’ and i was like ‘oooh’ and then rails and i was like ‘oooh’ and then javascript and node and this and that and i was like ‘OOOH’and here i am. learnin’.
