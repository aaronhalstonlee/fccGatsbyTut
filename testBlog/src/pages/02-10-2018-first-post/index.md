whew! i think i actually did it! i actually set up my blog on github with jekyll. from the permissions denied while ‘gem install’-ing to the theme i wanted having a completely different layout than the default ‘minima’, to some mysterious syntax error that github sent to me in a ‘site build fail’ email to some routing confusion. i actually did it. 
but then a friend suggested i check out gatsby/js. so i did that. i went through the official gatsby site's tutorial and then one from a freeCodeCamp article. hmmm. i like this stuff...

actually, this stuff is rad! it made WAY more sense to me than jekyll. not to knock jekyll. but i'm already familiar with JS, so it just makes sense.

so i finished these two tutorials which left me with a couple simple blog pages. then i chose the one i liked, deleted all my hard jekyll work from the repo and put in this one. 

finally. i have my blog set up. it's been on the back-burner for too long (same with my portfolio...).

react/js seems pretty badass, but i'm gonna have to table it for a few minutes so i can finish a couple other things i started before diving into it. i'm currently going through one of Udemy's Web Dev courses and freeCodeCamp, so i need to not get too involed with anything else until i finish one of these...
